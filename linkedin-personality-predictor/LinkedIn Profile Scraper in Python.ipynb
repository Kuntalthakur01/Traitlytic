[Filed Patent Ref No. 201731038573]. 96% accuracy was achieved. The project had three stages 1) preprocessing with analog filters, 2) Digital Signal Processing, 3) Machine Learning model thereafter data is uploaded to the cloud for further processing.Real-time Classification of Environmental Sounds & Their Impacts on Sleep QualityCollected audio using a microphone and Qualcomm’s Snapdragon processor enabled custom-built board running Android 6.0. Audio Cleaning, Feature Extraction (more than 700 features) in Temporal, Spectral, Energy, Harmonic, and Cepstral domain, Feature Selection for faster training and better accuracy and ML models (CNN, LSTM, RF, SVM) are designed to classify snoring and other sound and their impact on sleep quality.A Real-Time System and Methods for the Detection of Sleep Apnea and Sleep StageUsed CNN, Inception, LSTM, CNN-LSTM models to estimate Sleep Apnea and Sleep Stages using the respiration signal only. The training data was obtained from MESA, National Sleep Research Resource, USA. I did data cleaning and balancing thereafter feature engineering and selection were done before applying the ML model. Achieved 82.7% accuracy in Sleep Apnea which is higher than any known methods applied on respiration signal in MESA Dataset and achieved more than 80% accuracy in sleep stage classification which can be considered as good accuracy.Visit:http://www.sleepdoc.aihttp://www.facebook.com/mBreathOfficialhttp://www.twitter.com/mBreathOfficialThere are some of the project which I did at mBreath.\n",
